Over 37 million falls severe enough to require medical attention occur per year. Narcoleptic, epileptic, and elderly patients are population groups which are more prone to injury due to their more frequent and deadly falls. Often times these patients may lay in crippled agony or unconsciousness for long periods of time. Our android app helps look after these patients by detecting falls and calling for medical aid.
